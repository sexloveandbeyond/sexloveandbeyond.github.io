      <h4>How to get him to do everything for you</h4>
      <p>November 17th, 2019</p>
      <p>Proclaimer:<br>
This article revolves around sexual intercourse in groups of people. Irrelevant of my thoughts and experiences outlined in this article, I want to emphasize that I do NOT recommend trying it yourself if you are not persuaded that it is a good idea yourself.
Furthermore, if you have already had experience in sexual intercourse with multiple people at once, then this article can be regarded as superfluous.
      </p>
      <p>This is a rather unusual study since it’s not set in laboratory conditions, instead it’s set in my own bedroom. This means that it contains rather intimate insights in my personal life, which I usually avoid publicizing. Additionally it doesn’t proclaim to be a genuine scientific study but rather a collection of my thoughts. However the findings I got from it were too important for me not to share.
      </p>
      <p>I’m married with my husband since 4 years at the time of writing and in a romantic relationship with him several more years before that. Our sex life (with respect to frequency and passion) certainly declined since the peak of the early days. This is a rather common behavior described in many previous studies of colleagues in the field and myself too. As a response, there have been conducted even more studies on how to reverse this process. As both a wife and psychologist I am particularly interested in this. We have tried many of the suggestions emerging from the studies and some certainly helped, but usually only in a rather marginal way.
      </p>
      <p>One thing that all of the studies I have looked into in that respect had one thing in common: The protagonists consisted solely of the two members in the relationship.
      </p>
      <p>However, research in sexual behavior of the male sex suggests that a solution might be found in different approaches. When studying sexual behavior of humans, we typically distinguish between the male and the female sex. This is simply due to the fact that the different sexes have vastly different needs and wishes concerning sexual intercourse, which can mostly be traced back to evolutionary reasons. 
      </p>
      <p>A big finding in this respect, which is going to be the focus of this article, is that the male sex craves for diversity when it comes to his sexual partner(s). In a nutshell, this can be explained by the attempt to spread the genes of the male to a broad variety of females, maximizing diversity and the chances of successful distribution of the genes. An analysis of male interviewees asked for sexual preferences reflects these findings. Answers revolving around threesomes or orgies have coherently been amongst the highest rated. For more details I refer to the original studies and proceed with my approach of utilizing this information.
      </p>
      <p>I was interested if fulfilling men’s desire for sex with multiple women can have positive effects on the sex life of couples. I want to clarify that when I write about ‘men’s desire for sex with multiple women’, then this is obviously a generalized statement. There might certainly be men to which this doesn’t apply and therefore are exceptions from the statistical majority. Before intensely thinking about this topic, it didn’t cross my mind once that I could find joy in allowing (let alone being the driving force) to my husband having sexual contact with other women. But as I got more involved in the topic I got more and more curious, up to a point where I even wanted to try it on my own relationship.
      </p>
      <p>As most women probably would, I initially had many fears and doubts around the topic of my husband having other sexual partners beside me. I didn’t feel comfortable with ‘sharing’ my husband. After all he’s mine. I didn’t feel comfortable with the idea of him touching other women the way he touches me. I didn’t even feel comfortable with him <em>looking</em> at other women. I also didn’t understand why he could be attracted to other women. Does he think they are prettier? Am I not pretty enough? Am I not good enough in bed? What if he enjoys sex more with the other women?
      </p>
      <p>After taking a step back and approaching those concerns from a more rational angle, I realized that a lot of them have already been subject of psychological research. The results thereof turned out to be calming an I want to summarize them in the following paragraph:
      </p>
      <p>First of all, there’s nothing wrong with me, my appearance, or my performance in bed. As we saw earlier, the desire of men to pair up with a large amount of women is to be explained with evolutionary reasons and needs to be pulled apart from what men think of the sexual attractiveness of the women they are in a relationship with. To put it in other words: Even partners of gorgeous supermodels are likely to feel a certain desire towards other women. Moreover it might very well be that the man enjoys sex with the ‘new’ woman more than sex with his partner. Basically, this is exactly what one would except to happen. After all there wouldn’t be a longing for it on the man’s behalf if he would not enjoy it more than the sex is accustomed to. However, the same rules I talked about in the beginning of this article apply to the new women as to the partner: The initial increased desire for sexual intercourse with the new women will also decrease over time. Meaning that the different desires toward the two women are not correlated to the sexual attraction in and on itself, but rather timing and habit. In a last point covering the analyzation of my fears, I want to address the differentiation of sex and love. This is an ongoing theme throughout my work and a point that is particularly difficult to grasp for women (me included), since we have strongly differing views on that compared to men. While sex and love usually diffuse to one for women, they can be two very separate things for men. A popular example is prostitution, where men seek solely sexual pleasure while specifically having no interest in romance or love. (Of course there are some exceptions where men try to ‘buy love’, but this is far less common and another phenomenon.) Beside this, I can even see it in my own relationship, where sex can be very different, from something you might describe as ‘making love’ to much more superficial sex for mere joy. Realizing that sex out of love will remain something only between me and my husband made me feel much more positive.
      </p>
      <p>As mentioned, knowing that I can realize a big wish of my husband in addition to the new perspective on the topic plus my interest in finding out what effects it could have on a relationship to stimulate deep biological desires, made me want to try it out on my own relationship.
      </p>
      <p>This could be done in two ways: Allowing my husband to have sex with other women in my absence, or participating in the act myself, respectively, having a threesome.
      </p>
      <p>I turned out to be more interested in the latter for various reasons: The first of them simply being, that I felt more comfortable with the idea of being in the same room and having some influence, compared to him being completely alone with the other woman. Beyond that I felt like a threesome has even more appeal to a man than ‘traditional’ sex with only one sexual partner at a time. After all, a threesome is often described as ‘every man’s dream’ and I wanted to fulfill that wish of my husband. The last reason is of selfish nature. I never had sexual contact to other women (beyond kissing) before and I was indeed interested in this new experience and curious about how it would feel and wanted to try it at least once in my life.
      </p>
      <p>The next big question in this process is: Who should it be with? I decided for myself that I want it to be with a close friend of mine. While personal preferences may vary, I want to elaborate on why I came to this conclusion: The imagination of a complete stranger in my bed didn’t feel right to me. That is to one part due to hygiene and health. I simply don’t know if a stranger has any sexually transmissible diseases and I also didn’t want to invest a lot of time getting to know a stranger just to find out. The second reason was that I felt much more comfortable about the idea of being naked and intimate with someone that already knows how I look like without clothes and someone I can trust.  
      </p>
      <p>Finally I want to share what effects having a threesome had on my relationship. (Honestly it didn’t remain of only one threesome, but several more afterwards and this was surprisingly carried forward by me even more than by my husband.) Beside the fact that I enjoyed sexual intercourse with a woman more than expected, that my husband was very happy too, and multiple other pleasant synergies that I want to keep as a little secret to be discovered by you, the threesome(s) had one very profound effect that I want to accentuate: Interestingly, having a threesome did not only spark new excitement during this particular act, but carried over that excitement into the sex life consisting only of my husband and me. Several months later, I can observe much more sexual activity solely between my husband and me while a much higher percentage of that consisting of ‘making love’ compared to ‘sex out of mere joy’ as described earlier.
      </p>
      <p>Now, the headline was not meant to be clickbait. Although I enjoyed this experience probably as least as much as my husband (from a personal and professional standpoint), it can be framed in a way where you can gain even more than a happy husband and a revitalized sex life. Framing a threesome as a sacrifice you are willing to do in order to breath new life into your relationship, can cause men to do virtually anything to balance out your sacrifice to make it happen. Simply for the reason that this is a deep desire in most men as we saw earlier. I realize that making use of this can be seen as morally questionably, but I apply to your own sanity to use it in a positive way. It could also simply be that you’re thereby cementing your relationship because, let’s be honest, which man would want to leave a partner that is providing the opportunities for threesomes?
