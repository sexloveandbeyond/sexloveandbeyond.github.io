      <h4>Sexual satisfaction in committed relationships</h4>
      <p>December 5th, 2018</p>
      <p>This article seeks to explain how sexual satisfaction is created in committed relationships and how sexual satisfaction 
or dissatisfaction affects relationship happiness
and durability. Defining the terms is an important part
of this endeavor; however, the ability to do so is somewhat limited. For example, the word satisfaction can be
defined in various ways and satisfaction may mean different things to different people. Nonetheless, because
of a presumption that everyone knows what it means to
say that someone is satisfied or dissatisfied, much of the
literature on sexual satisfaction and relationship satisfaction never really defines the word. In most instances,
the measure of satisfaction is merely a question: How
satisfied are you with your sex life together? Or, in reference to another assumed understanding, researchers
might ask, How happy would you say you are with your
relationship right now? (McNulty & Fisher, 2008).
The idea here is that a subjective assessment using
open-ended questions is a better indicator of satisfaction
than a set of closed-ended questions, such as those that
might be used in a clinical test for depression (e.g., Do
you wake up in the morning ready and willing to face the
day?; Do you think your life is worse, average, or better
than that of the people you know?). These latter kinds of
assessments are more or less unknown in the sexual satisfaction literature. Indeed, large-scale studies on general
happiness (e.g., Yang, 2008) also follow the subjective
assessment model. Following these traditions—and because we are reviewing previous research rather than
doing our own—we will look at sexual and relationship
satisfaction as subjective assessments. In a few cases we
will consider negative subjective assessments (e.g., depression or sadness), but for the most part we are interested in the correlations between sexual behavior, other
relationship behavior, and partners’ feelings about their
sexual life and relationship as a couple.
      </p>
      <p>Without referring to the nonsexual satisfaction and
happiness literatures, people intuitively know what researchers have discovered: Satisfaction and happiness
are correlated with mental and physical health. Furthermore, research (Blumstein & Schwartz, 1983; HendersonKing & Veroff, 1994; Kurdek, 1991; Lawrence & Byers,
1995) has shown a general correlation between sexual
satisfaction and relationship satisfaction in both sameand opposite-sex couples. However, just as researchers
are not exactly sure which aspects of daily life produce
personal happiness, they remain a bit hazy—though not
clueless—on exactly what contributes to people’s sexual
satisfaction. Research has indicated, for example, that
sexual dissatisfaction is correlated with extramarital
sexuality (Bringle & Buunk, 1991) and that extramarital
sexuality places both same-sex and opposite-sex couples
at higher risk for dissolution (Blumstein & Schwartz).
Mutual monogamy is a cultural mandate in the
United States, Canada, most of Europe, and many other
parts of the world. Mandated monogamy for women
is almost universal. Research conducted in the United
States (Laumann, Gagnon, Michael, & Michaels, 1994)
has indicated that more than 85% of both men and
women believe that any committed relationship—but
especially marriage—requires monogamy. The findings
that nonmonogamy is stigmatized and creates risk of
crisis in relationships, plus the fact that the chances for
nonmonogamy are higher when couples are dissatisfied
with their sexual relationship, are powerful reasons to
pursue more information about what produces sexual
satisfaction within relationships.
Furthermore, we believe that sexuality has become a
much more important factor in people’s self-assessment
of personal happiness. Although not applicable to all
parts of the world, in advanced capitalist societies such
as the United States, Japan, Australia, and Europe,
sex—as marketing people so often say—sells. The average citizen is barraged with ads that link products with
sexual success and even with sexual adequacy. This
message can be subtle—or not: P. Diddy, a popular performer and musician, advertised his new line of clothes
on the May 18, 2008, edition of CBS Morning News as
fashion Viagra (Spoil The Ending, 2008). The marketing of most products as sexual aids (e.g., a 2008 Cadillac
commercial tag line: When you turn your car on, does it
return the favor?) means that even morally conservative
people cannot avoid media messaging that links sexuality with the so-called good life.
Leonore Tiefer’s (2001) analysis of this situation
went even deeper: She wrote that sexuality is now defined as the core of people’s identity and has been made
synonymous with competent enactment of masculinity
and femininity. In other words, given the emphasis on
sexuality as part of social success, cultural capital, selfworth, and gender normality, it is hard to imagine that
sexual satisfaction could be anything but important to
personal and relationship happiness. In fact, to go a bit
further, we believe that good sex—and, perhaps, great
sex—has become one of adult men’s and women’s expectations in life. This expectation becomes especially poignant in long-term committed relationships.
Finally, we also believe that the surfeit of sexual information provided via movies, books, and Internet sites,
as well as the almost universal experience of premarital
sexual experience by the age of 21 in the United States
and other industrialized countries, (Laumann et al.,
1994), has increased individual expectations about sexuality and has provided a comparative framework for assessing one’s partner’s abilities as a lover. At the same
time that sexual satisfaction is being touted as a right, it
is being glamorized in various media outlets. The result:
Individuals’ own basis of comparison has likely given
way to even higher standards for the quality of sexuality
in their relationships. These expectations may be dashed
if certain aspects of sex, such as frequency of intercourse
or amount of affectionate behavior, are perceived as deficient. By examining existing research, we seek to determine what troubles or supports sexual satisfaction and
how those factors affect couples’ short- and long-term
happiness, as well as their continuing commitment to
each other.
To that end, this article takes a closer look at the
elements of personal expectations, sexual performance,
identity, gender, desire, and values that affect sexual
satisfaction for individuals and couples. We also review
literature indicating what outside forces might make
meeting sexual expectations harder or easier, as well as
research examining other aspects of couples’ lives that
affect sexual satisfaction.
